start-hello: "*ü´° Welcome!*
      \n\nHello! I'm FriendlyBrocolli, your nofap companion.
      \n\n*‚õ∞Ô∏è Journeys and check-ins*
      \nEach attempt of quitting is called a journey that you can create with /new
      \nAfter creating a new journey, you can check-in with /check where you will indicate if you relapsed or not
      \nIt is recommended to check-in everyday, if you don't after 7 days, you will be automatically disqualified
      \n\n*üõ†Ô∏è Score, tasks and motivation*
      \nIf you get an urge, you can do a given /task that will reward you with 2-10 points
      \nYou can do 3 tasks/day maximum, if you still get urges, you can get /motivation
      \nEach clean day will reward you with 2 points and each check-in will reward you with 1 point
      \n\n*üë§ Profile and account*
      \nYou can see your score on your public /profile or your /account
      \nYour profile will show your public check-ins and basic statistics
      \nYour account will show all your check-ins and will allow you to download data
      \n\n*‚ÑπÔ∏è Need help?*
      \nHopefully, this introduction will help you, you can get more informations and resources with /help
      \nGood luck in your journey!" # space -> emoji
