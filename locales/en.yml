start-hello: |
    *ü´° Welcome!*
    Hello! I'm FriendlyBrocolli, your nofap companion.
  
    *‚õ∞Ô∏è Journeys and check-ins*
    Each attempt of quitting is called a journey that you can create with /new
    After creating a new journey, you can check-in with /check where you will indicate if you relapsed or not
    It is recommended to check-in at least once a day when you start
  
    *üõ†Ô∏è Score, tasks and motivation*
    If you get an urge, you can do a given /task that will reward you with 2-10 points
    You can do 3 tasks/day maximum, if you still get urges, you can get /motivation
    Each clean day will reward you with 2 points and each check-in will reward you with 1 point
  
    *üë§ Profile and account*
    You can see your score on your public /profile or your /account
    Your profile will show your public check-ins and basic statistics
    Your account will show all your check-ins and will allow you to download data
  
    *‚ÑπÔ∏è Need help?*
    Hopefully, this introduction will help you, you can get more informations and resources with /help
    Good luck in your journey!
